name: find-docs
description: >-
  Retrieves up-to-date documentation, API references, and code examples for any
  developer technology. Use this skill whenever the user asks about a specific
  library, framework, SDK, CLI tool, or cloud service — even for well-known ones
  like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. Your
  training data may not reflect recent API changes or version updates.

  Always use for: API syntax questions, configuration options, version migration
  issues, "how do I" questions mentioning a library name, debugging that involves
  library-specific behavior, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage.

  Use even when you think you know the answer — do not rely on training data
  for API details, signatures, or configuration options as they are frequently
  outdated. Always verify against current docs. Prefer this over web search for
  library documentation and API details.

# Documentation Lookup

Retrieve current documentation and code examples for any library using the Context7 CLI.

## Phase 3 Plan Verification Mode

When this prompt is loaded by `super-planning` during Phase 3, use it only when repository inspection shows that external documentation is needed. The repository is the first source of truth; this prompt validates new, ambiguous, version-sensitive, or otherwise unsupported implementation decisions rather than forcing a lookup for every technology.

Before planning tasks:

1. Read the approved spec's technology choices and inspect the repository manifests, lockfiles, runtime configuration, existing imports, wrappers, adapters, utilities, tests, examples, and neighboring implementations.
2. For each technology, decide whether the repository already provides a complete applicable pattern. If it does, do not run an external lookup; record `repository-pattern` and cite the relevant source paths.
3. Build an inventory of only the technologies that still require external verification: new integrations, missing precedent, unclear APIs, version-sensitive behavior, migration questions, or conflicting local patterns. Record installed or targeted versions.
4. Create one focused lookup question per remaining implementation decision. Include the repository context needed to distinguish framework versions, runtime constraints, and integration assumptions, but never include secrets, credentials, private data, or proprietary source code.
5. Verify each remaining decision with Context7 first. Resolve the library ID before querying docs, and use a version-specific ID when the project pins a version.
6. If Context7 is unavailable, errors, cannot resolve the library, reaches a quota limit, or lacks authoritative coverage, use web fetch/search against the official documentation, official repository, or governing specification. This fallback is mandatory; do not silently answer from model memory.
7. Compare the documentation result with the actual application context. Check that the documented API exists in the targeted version, that its runtime assumptions match the repository, and that the proposed use fits existing adapters, conventions, and constraints.
8. If a finding changes the architecture, task boundaries, dependency order, or acceptance criteria, update the plan before Phase 4. If it requires a product decision, stop and ask the user.

Return a documentation verification record for each researched technology with:

- technology and installed/targeted version;
- implementation question;
- lookup method: `repository-pattern`, `Context7`, or `official-web-fallback`;
- selected library ID when Context7 was used;
- authoritative source URL(s);
- verified API/configuration contract and version caveats;
- application-context mapping: relevant files, runtime, existing integration, and planned task;
- resulting plan decision;
- unresolved risk or explicit `none`.

The Phase 3 plan must preserve these records in its **Documentation Verification** section. A plan is not ready for decomposition until every material technology choice has a repository-pattern assessment and every required external lookup is complete.

Run commands with `npx ctx7@latest` so setup always uses the latest CLI without a global install:

```bash
npx ctx7@latest library <name> "<query>"
npx ctx7@latest docs <libraryId> "<query>"
```

Optionally install globally if you prefer a bare `ctx7` command:

```bash
npm install -g ctx7@latest
```

## Workflow

Two-step process: resolve the library name to an ID, then query docs with that ID.

```bash
# Step 1: Resolve library ID
npx ctx7@latest library <name> "<query>"

# Step 2: Query documentation
npx ctx7@latest docs <libraryId> "<query>"
```

You MUST call `library` first to obtain a valid library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format `/org/project` or `/org/project/version`.

IMPORTANT: Do not run these commands more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 attempts, use the best result you have.

## Step 1: Resolve a Library

Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns matching libraries.

```bash
npx ctx7@latest library React "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
npx ctx7@latest library "Next.js" "How to set up app router with middleware"
npx ctx7@latest library Prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

Use the official library name with proper punctuation (e.g., "Next.js" not "nextjs", "Customer.io" not "customerio", "Three.js" not "threejs"). If results look wrong, try alternate spellings such as `next.js` before changing the query.

Always pass a `query` argument — it is required and directly affects result ranking. Use the user's intent to form the query, which helps disambiguate when multiple libraries share a similar name. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

### Result fields

Each result includes:

- **Library ID** — Context7-compatible identifier (format: `/org/project`)
- **Name** — Library or package name
- **Description** — Short summary
- **Code Snippets** — Number of available code examples
- **Source Reputation** — Authority indicator (High, Medium, Low, or Unknown)
- **Benchmark Score** — Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)
- **Versions** — List of versions if available. Use one of those versions if the user provides a version in their query. The format is `/org/project/version`.

### Selection process

1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for
2. Select the most relevant match based on:
   - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)
   - Description relevance to the query's intent
   - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)
   - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative)
   - Benchmark score (higher is better, 100 is the maximum)
3. If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one
4. If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements
5. For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match

### Version-specific IDs

If the user mentions a specific version, use a version-specific library ID:

```bash
# General (latest indexed)
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js "How to set up app router"

# Version-specific
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87 "How to set up app router"
```

The available versions are listed in the `library` command output. Use the closest match to what the user specified.

## Step 2: Query Documentation

Retrieves up-to-date documentation and code examples for the resolved library.

```bash
npx ctx7@latest docs /facebook/react "How to clean up useEffect with async operations"
npx ctx7@latest docs /vercel/next.js "How to add authentication middleware to app router"
npx ctx7@latest docs /prisma/prisma "How to define one-to-many relations with cascade delete"
```

### Writing good queries

The query directly affects the quality of results. Be specific and include relevant details, but keep each query to one topic — if the question spans multiple distinct concepts, run a separate `docs` command per concept instead of combining them, unless the question is about how the concepts interact. Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, personal data, or proprietary code in your query.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Good | `"How to set up authentication with JWT in Express.js"` |
| Good | `"React useEffect cleanup function with async operations"` |
| Bad (too vague) | `"auth"` |
| Bad (too vague) | `"hooks"` |
| Bad (too broad) | `"routing and auth and caching in Next.js"` |

Use the user's full question as the query when possible — vague one-word queries return generic results, and multi-topic queries dilute ranking and return shallow results for each topic.

The output contains two types of content: **code snippets** (titled, with language-tagged blocks) and **info snippets** (prose explanations with breadcrumb context).

## Authentication

Works without authentication. For higher rate limits:

```bash
# Option A: environment variable
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your_key

# Option B: OAuth login
npx ctx7@latest login
```

## Error Handling

If a command fails with a quota error ("Monthly quota reached" or "quota exceeded"):
1. Inform the user their Context7 quota is exhausted
2. Suggest they authenticate for higher limits: `npx ctx7@latest login`
3. Use official documentation through web fetch/search for the current lookup and record `official-web-fallback` in the verification record

If Context7 is unavailable for any other reason, use the same official-web fallback and record why Context7 was not used. Do not silently fall back to training data.

## Common Mistakes

- Library IDs require a `/` prefix — `/facebook/react` not `facebook/react`
- Always run `npx ctx7@latest library` first — `npx ctx7@latest docs react "hooks"` will fail without a valid ID
- Use descriptive queries, not single words — `"React useEffect cleanup function"` not `"hooks"`
- One topic per query — split `"routing and auth and caching"` into a separate `docs` command per concept, unless the question is about how they interact
- Do not include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials) in queries
